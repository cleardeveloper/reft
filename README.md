# REFT Cosmology

This is an open research project exploring whether redshift and cosmic structure can be explained without dark energy, inflation, or singularity-based models.

The Render-Engine Field Tension (REFT) model interprets observed redshift not as velocity-based expansion, but as the result of curvature steepening in space—a funnel-like geometry from an initial rupture event. Local gravitational anchors (like black holes) flatten curvature, suppressing expansion.

## Why This Exists

We’re not trying to rewrite textbooks. We’re trying to make them more accurate—for ourselves, and for anyone working on projects that depend on cosmological assumptions actually making sense.

We are open to critique, collaboration, and constructive takedowns. If this theory breaks, we want to know where—and why.
