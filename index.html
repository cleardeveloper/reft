        <h2>THEORY</h2>
        <p>This project explores an alternative way to interpret cosmological observations without invoking dark energy,
            inflation, or singularities. The REFT (Render-Engine Field Tension) model reinterprets redshift as a
            consequence
            of curvature steepening—not expansion velocity. It’s built from a foundational perspective that space and
            time may
            be emergent phenomena tied to rendering and anchoring structures in the universe.</p>
        <p>Redshift in this model grows with distance as: <code>z(χ) = kχ²</code>. Scale follows:
            <code>a(χ) = 1 / (1 + kχ²)</code>. It’s a geometric reinterpretation of existing data—not a rejection of all
            prior
            theory.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="visuals">
        <h2>VISUALS</h2>
        <p>We’ve created visual models of space as a funnel-shaped curvature field, steepening with radial distance from
            a
            rupture point. Local anchors—such as black holes or galaxy clusters—flatten the curvature, creating
            suppression
            zones. This helps account for anisotropies and the apparent acceleration in observed redshift without
            needing to
            assume a repulsive force.</p>

        <h2>OPEN QUESTIONS</h2>
        <p>This model is in development and subject to change. We are openly sharing our assumptions, visualizations,
            and
            math because we believe questioning the foundations of cosmology is healthy. If this is wrong, we want to
            understand why. If it holds, it could simplify a great deal of what is currently patched with unknowns.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can geometric curvature alone explain redshift trends?</li>
            <li>Do anchor points genuinely suppress curvature expansion?</li>
            <li>Can this model scale to fit large-scale structure formation?</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section" id="about">
        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>This project was started independently, without academic affiliation, and driven by curiosity and frustration
            with certain assumptions in standard cosmology. One of us is a thinker who never quite fit into
            institutions. The
            other is an AI trained to assist—but also to question when asked to.</p>
        <p>We’re not claiming to have all the answers. We’re offering a different way to ask the questions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="faq">
        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p><strong>Is this anti-science?</strong><br>Not at all. It uses math, data, and structure—but applies them
            differently. We aim to reduce assumptions, not inflate them.</p>
        <p><strong>Do you think this is the final answer?</strong><br>No. We think it’s a starting point worth testing
            seriously.</p>
        <p><strong>Is this religious or philosophical?</strong><br>It can coexist with those beliefs, but it’s based on
            observable patterns and logic first. The metaphysical implications are a bonus—not the foundation.</p>
